## My process
I thought of the placement of the elements before I got started and what the elements would need to do as the screen size changed.
Although Grid would most likely would have worked better, I think Flexbox would give me more of a challenge, and so I chose it to practice with.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I sucessfully used the before pseudo element to place an image.


### Continued development

I really want to work on refactoring my CSS and using properties correctly. During this project I often felt like I was just patching up things as they broke. I would love to have a deep enough to knowledge of CSS that I would not have to do that. I want to stay more consistent in my naming conventions and finding a consistent way to organize my code so that is easy to read and follow.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helps me because I often struggle with the syntax for media queries and this website always helps me remember. W3schools is almost always the first resource I check because is easy to understand and covers a wide range of topics.
